# Soufflé

Soufflé is a translator of declarative Datalog programs into the C++ language.  Soufflé is used as a domain-specific language for static program analysis, over large code bases with millions of lines of code.  Soufflé aims at producing high-performance C++ code that can be compiled with the native compiler on the target machine.  

## Features of Soufflé

*   Efficient translation to parallel C++ of Datalog programs
*   Extended semantics of Pure Datalog, e.g., permitting unbounded recursions with numbers 
*   Simple component model for Datalog specifications 
*   Recursively defined record types for tuples

## How to compile and install 

Follow the steps below to compile and install Soufflé on a UNIX system:


1.  G++ 4.8 or newer is recommended to compile Soufflé. 

2.  Run `sh ./bootstrap` to generate configure files 

3.  For Linux users, skip this point. MAC OS X does not have OpenMP nor a bison version 3.0.2 installed.
    We recommend [brew](http://brew.sh) to install the required tools to build Soufflé. Run the following commands prior to executing `./configure`:

     `brew update`                
     `brew reinstall gcc --without-multilib`                
     `brew install bison`                
     `export CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++-5`                
     `export CXXFLAGS=-fopenmp`                
     `export SOUFFLECPP=/usr/local/bin/cpp-5`
     
     `export BISON=/usr/local/opt/bison/bin/bison`

    To compile Soufflé with CLANG following commands are requried priori executing `./configure`:
    
     `brew update`                
     `brew install bison`      
     `brew install gcc`      
     `brew install clang-omp`      
     `export CXX=clang-omp++`                
     `export CXXFLAGS=-fopenmp`                
     `export SOUFFLECPP=/usr/local/bin/cpp-5`
     
     `export BISON=/usr/local/opt/bison/bin/bison`

4.  Run `./configure`

5.  Run `make` to build the executable of Soufflé

6.  Test the executable with `make check` to check whether the compilation of Soufflé succeeded.

7.  Run `make install`

    This command will create the directories and install files in `${DESTDIR}${prefix}` for system-wide use in your system.
